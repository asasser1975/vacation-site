WHAT EVENT?
Outdoors call to me.
Shopping and civilization are my thing!
Winter is my happy place!
Gimme sand and surf, baby!
I'm not happy until I'm knee-deep in mud or hiking in the wild wilderness.

HOW DIFFICULT TO GET TO?
The middle of nowhere sounds good
Off the beaten path
Far away but still within a civilization
One plane hop might be alright...
A direct flight within the country is the way for me

COST?
I am on a budget that I'd like to adhere to
I budget but am willing to stretch for a fabulous opportunity
Money is no object - bring it
