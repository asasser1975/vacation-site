WHAT EVENT?
Outdoors call to me.
Shopping and civilization are my thing!
Winter is my happy place!
Gimme sand and surf, baby!
I'm not happy until I'm knee-deep in mud or hiking in the wild wilderness.

HOW DIFFICULT TO GET TO?
I like getting away from it all
It doesn't matter really - at home anywhere
I prefer staying close to creature comforts and civilization

COST?
I am on a budget that I'd like to adhere to
I budget but am willing to stretch for a fabulous opportunity
Money is no object - I'd go anywhere

HOW FAR?
I'd like to stay in the States
I'm open to larger cities around the globe
Anywhere on earth - I like to see things
